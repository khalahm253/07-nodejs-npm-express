# 07 Nodejs npm express

**Author**: Khalil and Amanda
**Version**: 1.0.0 (increment the patch/fix version number up if you make more commits past your first submission)

## Overview
We want to add the ability to run a local node server to our application.  We want to be able to create new articles and allow those new articles to be retrieved via the local node server.

## Getting Started
A user must install express, locally, on their machine, and then run a node server on their local host.  The user has to set their port with a default of 3000, set up the routes, and set the application to listen from their port.

## Architecture
HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, ExpressJS, NodeJS, node and nodemon, JSON, etc.
